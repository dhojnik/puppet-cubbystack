# Generic

This generic profile can be used for a few use-cases:

## Basic Template

Use this as the basis for other profiles.

## All-in-one Configuration

An all-in-one OpenStack environment consists of a single server that has all OpenStack components running on it. Since this profile contains all settings required by a standard OpenStack configuration, it is compatible with an all-in-one environment.

## Simple Environments

As mentioned above, this profile contains all settings required by a standard OpenStack configuration. However, it's possible to run certain OpenStack components with less settings.

If this profile is used on multiple servers, then certain servers will receive more configuration options than they really need. There is nothing technically wrong with this. If this is acceptable to you, then you can easily use this profile for a multi-server environment.
